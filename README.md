This is the space for UX project about family connection.

### Project Idea: A Family Fitness APP
#### Tentitive Title: LetsFit! 
Inspired by my conversation with my parents, I want to design an app that help family members to create fitness plans, workout together or individually, share data and achievements. I would like to adopt gamefication elements to encourage family members to stay fit together and promote healthy habits.
My dad love sports and exercise every day. He cares a lot about whether I exercise regularly and have rest after sitting for a long time before the computer. I think a family fitness app will help me to be more motivated to workout with my family and live a healthier life.
