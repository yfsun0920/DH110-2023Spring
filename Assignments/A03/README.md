DGT HUM 110: User Interface and Design

## ✅ Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

- This project would support users to stay active with their family members and connect them through fitness activities. It encourages regular physical activities and promotes a healthy lifestyle for all family members. The project aims to create an engaging fitness experience for families that not only helps improve the physical well-being but also strengthens emotional connections and family bonds by promoting shared experiences and collaborative achievements.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
- The family fitness activity fulfills the love and social belonging needs, as it fosters connection, bonding, and a sense of community among family members and other users. As family members motivate and support each other during the shared experience, they strengthen their emotional bonds. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Currently, there are many ways families have sought to satisfy their needs for love and social belonging. However, the solutions vary based on the distance between family members. For instance, families who can meet in person would share meals, celebrate holidays, participate in cultural or religious practices, and engage in recreational activities together. For families who cannot meet often, the solutions mainly involve phone calls or video calls that help facilitate communication between family members.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
- One limitation that could potentially be improved is the shared experience for family members when they cannot meet often. Families living far apart or in different time zones may find it challenging to maintain regular communication and bonding experiences. Digital technology can bridge this gap by offering more bonding activities and communication mediums that help families stay connected despite the distance.


## ✅ Step02: Target users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
- The targeted users have a wide age range, from young children to elderly family members, with varying fitness levels and abilities. They care about family members' well being and are willing to live a healthy lifestyle. They are looking for ways to encourage healthy habits and physical activity in their families, as well as to participate in fitness activities as a family. They would not need any particular level of expertise

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
- There are several ways users can engage with family fitness. User will be able to access to health data and fitness goals of their family members anywhere using the phone. When they are with their family members, they can also do physical activities together at home or outdoor.

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
- The goal of family fitness is to stay active and improve overall health. Families would plan fitness activities that align with their goals and preferences and engage in the fitness activities together. They would also track their progess and encourage each other to stay motivated.


## Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.39-42)
