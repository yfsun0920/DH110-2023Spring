DGT HUM 110: User Interface and Design

## ✅ Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

- This project would support users to stay active with their family members and connect them through fitness activities. It encourages regular physical activities and promotes a healthy lifestyle for all family members. The project aims to create an engaging fitness experience for families that not only helps improve the physical well-being but also strengthens emotional connections and family bonds by promoting shared experiences and collaborative achievements.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
- The family fitness activity fulfills the love and social belonging needs, as it fosters connection, bonding, and a sense of community among family members and other users. As family members motivate and support each other during the shared experience, they strengthen their emotional bonds. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Currently, there are many ways families have sought to satisfy their needs for love and social belonging. However, the solutions vary based on the distance between family members. For instance, families who can meet in person would share meals, celebrate holidays, participate in cultural or religious practices, and engage in recreational activities together. For families who cannot meet often, the solutions mainly involve phone calls or video calls that help facilitate communication between family members.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
- One limitation that could potentially be improved is the shared experience for family members when they cannot meet often. Families living far apart or in different time zones may find it challenging to maintain regular communication and bonding experiences. Digital technology can bridge this gap by offering more bonding activities and communication mediums that help families stay connected despite the distance.


## ✅ Step02: Target users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 


## Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.39-42)
