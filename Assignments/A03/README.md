DGT HUM 110: User Interface and Design

## ✅ Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

- This project would support users to stay active with their family members and connect them through fitness activities. It encourages regular physical activities and promotes a healthy lifestyle for all family members. The project aims to create an engaging fitness experience for families that not only helps improve the physical well-being but also strengthens emotional connections and family bonds by promoting shared experiences and collaborative achievements.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
- The family fitness activity fulfills the love and social belonging needs, as it fosters connection, bonding, and a sense of community among family members and other users. As family members motivate and support each other during the shared experience, they strengthen their emotional bonds. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Currently, there are many ways families have sought to satisfy their needs for love and social belonging. However, the solutions vary based on the distance between family members. For instance, families who can meet in person would share meals, celebrate holidays, participate in cultural or religious practices, and engage in recreational activities together. For families who cannot meet often, the solutions mainly involve phone calls or video calls that help facilitate communication between family members.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
- One limitation that could potentially be improved is the shared experience for family members when they cannot meet often. Families living far apart or in different time zones may find it challenging to maintain regular communication and bonding experiences. Digital technology can bridge this gap by offering more bonding activities and communication mediums that help families stay connected despite the distance.


## ✅ Step02: Target users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
- The targeted users have a wide age range, from young children to elderly family members, with varying fitness levels and abilities. They care about family members' well being and are willing to live a healthy lifestyle. They are looking for ways to encourage healthy habits and physical activity in their families, as well as to participate in fitness activities as a family. They would not need any particular level of expertise

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
- There are several ways users can engage with family fitness. User will be able to access to health data and fitness goals of their family members anywhere using the phone. When they are with their family members, they can also do physical activities together at home or outdoor.

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
- The goal of family fitness is to stay active and improve overall health. Families would plan fitness activities that align with their goals and preferences and engage in the fitness activities together. They would also track their progess and encourage each other to stay motivated.


## Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 

The research method I chose is context inquary, which is a combination of participatory observation, and interview.
The session consisted of the following sections:

1. Introduction and Background questions a. I wanted to learn about what is the fitness routine of family willing to live a healthy life, and how my project could support those daily tasks. I also asked about the attitude towards past experience.

2. Participatory Observation

- I observed 3 activities: doing some exercise with a family member, reacting to grandparents concern about their health, and sharing information about family well being. During each activity, I ask the participant to think aloud and after that I ask follow-up questions regarding her thoughts.

3. Follow-up questions

- I ask the participant about expectations and frustrations about family fitness and look for opportunities to improve the experience.


## ✅ Step04: Plan the details

## ✅ Step06: Organize/Documentation

### Insights from the Interview
- Lack of motiviation even with gamefication elements (Part 1 14:24)
> I have played Pokemen Go for a very short period of time. And I think it does work because these things are cute. I find them so I have to walk to some locations to find them. And I think that there's a software that tracks my water every day. And yeah, and the water I drink will just turn to the water that I plant to flowers. I think it doesn't keep me motivated because it's just very new and fresh to me when I first and then after maybe two days, I will just know that my flower will not grow. So I will just not drink more water anymore.

- Need for personalization and reliance on recommendation algorithm (Part 2 6:40)
> I think one thing is that I'm very familiar with how it works. And also the searching results have also already fitted to my preferences. So it will show the videos that I'm most used to opening....the software has already gotten used to my preferences.

- Family members care about fitness data and know about each others' daily life (Part 2 11:28)
> Yeah, I think my mom has me as a close friend. So she put me on the top. If I walk like zero steps, she would notice and then ask me why you didn't go out.

- Frustration about keeping all family members motivated to do exercise together (Part 2 18:45)
> I think that they usually respond to my shares but sometimes they might say they would do the exercise later. It is not as efficient as if I asked them in person.

- Concerns about family members' well beings and willingness to make changes (Part 2 19:43)
> I feel like they should be more motivated because everyone is not in good health. And we need to exercise and sometimes we all get too lazy. I just feel like if we have a chance to do it together either in person or online that might be a good experience and also a good opportunity to just relax from work.

- Digital technology might interfere the immerse experience spending with family (Part 3 07:41)
>  I think bowling activities are kind of, I would place it in the category of leisure. I don't think it requires a lot of skills... So I feel like for that kind of activity, I don't need the technology to help with any guidance. And it's also better for us to immerse in that. 


### Reflection
Through the research process, I built empathy with my participant and tried to understand her by putting myself into her situation. By understanding from her perspectives I tried to give up all the preassumptions I had before. I learned about the needs, preferences, and challenges families face when engaging in fitness activities together. Personalization and flexibility become important to keep all family members motivated. I also gained insights into the role technology playing both positive and probably negative effects on family connection. Whereas it can play in supporting family fitness activities and bridging gaps in motivation and communication for long distance, it might interfere the connecting experience spending time with families in person.

I also find out a lot of problems when I am review the recording and transcript. There are many thing I can improve if I do it again in the future. First, I should prepare a more comprehensive interview guideline. Merely having a list of questions was not sufficient. Sometimes, participant's answers were unrelated to the questions I wanted to ask, requiring me to provide more guidance and instruction to help her express thoughts. Moreover, I need to be more flexible in adapting my questions during the process. I noticed that the participant occasionally addressed questions I planned to ask later, but I still repeated the questions, which was unnecessary.

Another area for improvement is to imporve my way of guidance. I sometimes gave too many examples and the participant would simply chose from what I said. This might lead to some biased result. I should give the participant more time to think about herself and try to ask questions in differnt ways instead of providing her choices to select.
