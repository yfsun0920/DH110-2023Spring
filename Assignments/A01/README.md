## Project Idea: A Family Fitness APP
Inspired by my conversation with my parents, I want to design an app that help family members to create fitness plans, workout together or individually, share data and achievements. It can encourage family members to stay fit together and promote healthy habits.
My dad love sports and exercise every day. He cares a lot about whether I exercise regularly and have rest after sitting for a long time before the computer. I think a family fitness app will help me to be more motivated to workout with my family and live a healthier life.
