# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
by Yifei Sun

## Project Idea: A Family Fitness APP
Inspired by my conversation with my parents, I want to design an app that help family members to create fitness plans, workout together or individually, share data and achievements. It can encourage family members to stay fit together and promote healthy habits.
My dad love sports and exercise every day. He cares a lot about whether I exercise regularly and have rest after sitting for a long time before the computer. I think a family fitness app will help me to be more motivated to workout with my family and live a healthier life.


### Heuristic Evaluation
| Number | Heuristic | Description |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| #1 | Visibility of system status | Provide timely and appropriate feedback to keep users informed of the ongoing situation |
| #2 | Match between system and the real world | Present information in a natural and logical sequence that follows real-world conventions. |
| #3 | User control and freedom | Have a clearly marked exit to leave the unwanted action  |
| #4 | Consistency and standards | Follow platform and industry conventions |
| #5 | Error prevention | Remove conditions that are prone to errors, or verify them and offer a confirmation option |
| #6 | Recognition rather than recall | Promote recognition through interface and reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users |
| #7 | Flexibility and efficiency of use | Flexible choices for both inexperienced and experienced users |
| #8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | Information that is irrelevant or infrequently required should not be included |
| #9 | Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Error messages should be written in plain language, indicate the issue, and offer a constructive solution. |
| #10 | Help and documentation | Provide documentation to help users understand how to complete tasks |

### Severity Ratings
| Rating | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

### Description
Exercise: At Home Workout App provides a variety of workouts that can be done at home, including yoga, pilates, and bodyweight exercises. It also includes customized workout plans based on fitness level and goals, and allows to track progress over time. 

### Overall Evaluation
Developed by a game company, the app uses gamification to create a fun and engaging experience of workout with cute avatars, animations and achievement system. Overall it has a good user experience design. It has a well-organized layout with a clear navigation system. The visual design is appealing, using bright and energetic colors. All these consistent elements are great fit for children as well as their parents as their targeted users.

### Heuristic evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of system status
| Rating | Evaluation  |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | In the workout session, the app has a countdown timer to help users know about current position during the process. To imporve, it can probably use a progress bar that is constantly shrinking to give the feeling of time. In addition, before starting each session, the app can provide an estimated time beforehand and let the users have an expectation. |

#### 2. Match between system and the real world
| Rating | Evaluation  |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | The app does a great job using visual language and avoiding jargons. A cartoon character is guiding through the workout process, telling what movement to make by directly showing instead of depicting. There is not much text in this app, and most of them are plain language and easy to understand. |

#### 3. User control and freedom
| Rating | Evaluation  |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | In each workout session there is always a exit button on the top left corner of the screen. As the user click the button, it immediately exits the workout session and goes back to the main page. I think this makes entering and exiting a session too easy and the users have less motivation to complete the whole session. I would suggest to have an extra window asking to ensure whether the users want to exit and encourage them to stay to complete the tasks. |

#### 4. Consistency and standards
| Rating | Evaluation  |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | The app uses conventional layout and user flows that are very easy to understand. The four sections are clearly divided at the bottom screen with text and icons. Profile section is on the top right corner. The main screen requires the user to swipe to interact. The behavior is clearly indicated with small dots at the bottom and the card layout style.  |

#### 5. Error prevention

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of user

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
| Rating | Evaluation  |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | The aesthetic of the app is super clean and engaging. There is not irrelevant information on the screen. Instructions are mostly illustrated by cartoon characters and animations. These elements are great fit for children who are targeted users of this app. |

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors


#### 10. Help and documentation
| Rating | Evaluation  |
| --- | ----------- |
| 3 | The app does not include a section for help and documentation. If users meet difficulties using some features in the app, the only way to seek for help in the app is to send email to the support team. However, this method is not efficient to solve problems quickly. Users might feel frustrated and give up using if the problem is not solved immediately. The app can imporve this by adding a section of FAQ listing questions and answers users often have. |
