DGT HUM 110: User Interface and Design

## Introduction
### Summary
The family fitness app “LetsFit!” aims at fostering a healthier lifestyle among family members through shared fitness experiences and a sense of community. The app is intended to appeal to a wide range of family members, with differing fitness levels and interests, providing a platform to track individual and collective progress and engage in friendly competition.

### Purpose
The wireframe for this family fitness app was designed to be simple and intuitive, reflecting the needs and preferences of the user personas. It featured a clean layout with clear navigation options, ensuring users could easily find and use the app's various features.

The purpose of this interface design was not only to create a functional and user-friendly fitness app but also to facilitate connection, motivation, and healthy habits among family members. The app's design aims to strike a balance between individual fitness tracking and family-oriented features.

For readability on screens and modern aesthetic, I choose to start with Sans Serif fonts. I try three fonts: Poppins, Roboto, and Graphik.

I finally decide to use Poppins for its geometric, rounded characteristics, which make it look friendly and approachable. These align well with the fitness application that creates an engaging and warm environment for all family members regardless of age.

Poppins is a versatile font that maintains good legibility across a wide range of sizes and weights. This ensures that all titles, instructions and fitness statistics can be easily read and understood.
