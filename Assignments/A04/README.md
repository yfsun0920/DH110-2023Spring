### Why Harold is using the app

Harold is a 68-year-old grandfather of two children and three grandchildren. He has a goal to maintain his health and independence while also encouraging his family to adopt a healthier lifestyle. He believes that staying connected to his family's fitness journey and fostering communication would be the key to achieving this goal. This is why Harold decides to use the family fitness app, as it offers a way to monitor his family's daily fitness data, allowing him to track their progress and motivate them to stay committed to their fitness goals.

### How Harold is using the app

One evening after dinner, Harold opens the family fitness app on his phone and navigates to the section where he can check each family membersâ€™ daily fitness data. He sees that his grandson Tommy has exceeded his daily step goal. Feeling proud of Tommy's achievement, Harold sends him a congratulatory message. Meanwhile, he notices that his daughter Jessica, who is always busy with her work, is close to reaching her daily exercise minutes goal. Wanting to positively impact her progress, Harold sends her an uplifting message, encouraging her to complete her goal before the day ends.

Inspired by his family's progress and motivated to lead by example, Harold decides to go for a walk around the neighborhood to reach his own daily step goal. While walking, he receives a notification that Jessica has reached her goal, filling him with pride and happiness. Upon returning home, Harold updates his progress on the app and shares a message with his family about his evening walk, hoping to inspire them to keep up with their fitness journey.
