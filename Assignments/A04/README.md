#### How Jessica is using the app
- One Sunday morning, Jessica explores that the family fitness app has a personalized fitness plan feature.

With a well-rounded plan in mind, Jessica schedules these activities into their shared family calendar. She then notifies her family through the app, informing them about their upcoming exercise routines for the week. As the days go by, Jessica observes her family members enjoying the customized activities and feeling motivated to complete them, thanks to the personalized touch. By the end of the week, Jessica is satisfied with the results.
