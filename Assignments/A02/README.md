DGT HUM 110: User Interface and Design

## Introduction: Exercise: At Home App
Exercise: At Home Workout App (also called 7 Minute Workouts with Lazy Monster) is a fitness app that provides a variety of workouts that can be done at home, such as yoga, pilates, and bodyweight exercises. The app also includes customized workout plans based on fitness level and goals, and allows for tracking progress over time.

Some usability issues I discovered during heuristic evulation involves the interactions during the workout sessions, the easy-to-use of the profile and setting page, and the consistency in overall design. I came up with some scenarios to interact with the product and conduct a usability testing to gain more insights. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing
The purpose of the usability testing is to find out how to improve the app from the user's perspective. Usability involves effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product design. Usability testing collects empirical data from the observation on how the users interact with the product.

## Methodology

The usability test will be conducted in a quiet room. The moderator will record the screen as well as the participant's reactions throughout the test and guide the participant with questions or actions. The entire process was conducted on Google Forms.

Process:
- Introduction
- Informed consent
- Background questions
- Pre-test questions
- Three tasks
- Post-test questionnaire
- System usability scale (SUS)
- Production satisfaction card
- Demographic data

The pre-test questionnaire intends to ask about the first impression and the intuitiveness of the terminology or graphical user interface of the App. Tasks and scenarios helps to provide insight about the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product. The post-test questionnaire measures the overall evaluation.

## Reflection
Overall, the testing went smoothly. The process included background questions, task scenarios, and a reflection part, providing me with valuable insights into the user experience. This helped identify both strengths and areas for improvement within the app.

The task scenarios allowed the participant to interact with various features of the app in a structured manner. Observing their actions and listening to their thought processes gave me insights into the app's intuitiveness and potential barriers. It also highlighted the effectiveness of the gamification elements in keeping the user engaged and motivated. Before the test, I anticipated possible issues when using some features. However, the participant reacted smoothly to each step, indicating that my assumptions might have been incorrect.

In the final part of the test, I gathered feedback on the participant's overall experience and discussed any additional thoughts she had. Observing how she would likely navigate the app without instructions allowed me to gain a more comprehensive understanding of her engagement with the app.c
