# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype

### by Yifei Sun
DGT HUM 110: User Interface and Design

## üìù Project Description
LetsFit! is a Family Fitness App designed to help families engage in physical activities together while fostering connection, communication, and a healthier lifestyle. It offers features including monitoring family members' daily fitness data, providing personalized fitness plans, and incorporating gamification elements to keep users motivated and engaged.

## üîç Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of creating an interactive prototype is to bring the Family Fitness App to life in a way that is both visually appealing and functionally representative of the final product. The process requires a thorough understanding of the user flow, the app's functionality, and interaction design. By creating an interactive prototype, designers can simulate the actual user experience, which is important for identifying and addressing potential usability issues.

## üìå Process
The process begins with the translation of low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity interactive prototypes. This involves incorporating the final decisions on visual design elements such as color palette, typography, shapes, and layout. The goal is to make the prototype as close to the final product as possible in terms of look, feel, and interaction. Once the high-fidelity prototype is created, it undergoes a cognitive walkthrough. Feedback is collected, analyzed, and used to iterate the design. The prototype is refined to ensure that the final product is user-centered, effective, and delightful to use.

## üìé Prototype Tasks
1. Find personalized fitness solutions:
- On boarding: sign up for a new account, join an existing family group
- Complete the first workout (tank top arms), share the progress with the family

2. Create customize fitness plan for family members
- View each members plan with a calendar view

3. View daily step leaderboard and achievements

4. Monitor family members‚Äô fitness progress and send motivational messages

## üö∂ Cognitive Walkthrough

### Process
Cognitive walkthrough is a usability testing method that explores the intuitiveness of a product. It involves simulating typical user tasks and asking probing questions at each step, aiming to identify potential gaps a new user might face.

During the process, I asked the tester to go over all four tasks of my app following each steps. She also has some time navigating throughout the app herself. Then I ask her questions about overall feelings and thought over specific details in the design.

### Summary of Findings

The cognitive walkthrough went smoothly overall and the design seems to have been well-received. The tester was able to navigate through all four tasks smoothly, indicating that the user flow and interface are intuitive and easy to follow. She loved the visual designs and found it engaging.

However, the tester had some confusion at first sight of the Plan page. The calendar functionality was not immediately clear to the tester. 

Overall I found out that I became more confident in conducting user testing compared to before. As the process went on, I had a clearer structure of my product and improved my ability to guide through a testing. I felt more comfortable asking follow-up questions to receive insightful feedbacks

### Area of Improvement

Based on the feedback, revisions should focus on enhancing the clarity and usability of the calendar on the Plan page. I also need to figure out the animation of the interactive prototype which makes pressing tabs easy to understand. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Iterations: Prototype Version 2

Based on the cognitive walkthrough and my own revisions, I redesign several pages and the interactions to improve the user experience.
