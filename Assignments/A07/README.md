## Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of creating an interactive prototype is to bring the Family Fitness App to life in a way that is both visually appealing and functionally representative of the final product. The process requires a thorough understanding of the user flow, the app's functionality, and interaction design. By creating an interactive prototype, designers can simulate the actual user experience, which is important for identifying and addressing potential usability issues.

## Process
The process begins with the translation of low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity interactive prototypes. This involves incorporating the final decisions on visual design elements such as color palette, typography, shapes, and layout. The goal is to make the prototype as close to the final product as possible in terms of look, feel, and interaction. Once the high-fidelity prototype is created, it undergoes a cognitive walkthrough. Feedback is collected, analyzed, and used to iterate the design. The prototype is refined to ensure that the final product is user-centered, effective, and delightful to use.
